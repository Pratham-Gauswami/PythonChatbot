# Chatbot Development Repository

This repository contains various Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and text files related to the development of a chatbot and associated embedding and clustering functionalities. Each file serves a distinct purpose within the project, such as training, embedding, and testing the chatbot, as well as utilizing external libraries and databases.

## Files Overview

- **ChatBot2.py, ChatBot3.py, ChatBot4.py, ChatBot6.py, ChatBot8.py, ChatBot9.py**  
  Python scripts for different stages and versions of the chatbot model development. Each file might contain unique functionalities, incremental improvements, or experimental features.

- **ChatBot5.ipynb**  
  Jupyter notebook version of the chatbot, possibly used for interactive development, testing, or analysis.

- **ClusterEmb.py**  
  Script for clustering embeddings, which may be used to group similar responses or topics for the chatbot.

- **Cohere.ipynb, Cohere.py**  
  Files dedicated to integrating or experimenting with the Cohere API for language processing capabilities.

- **Embed.py, TxtEmb.py**  
  Embedding scripts that likely handle text-to-vector conversions, necessary for similarity matching and semantic analysis in the chatbot.

- **Sql.py**  
  SQL-related operations, potentially for managing a database backend or performing SQL queries to support chatbot responses.

- **Sample2.py, Sample3.py, sample.py**  
  Sample scripts which may contain test cases or serve as examples for testing various chatbot features.

- **Doc2.txt, rough.txt**  
  Text files that might contain documentation, sample input data, or notes for the project.

- **.DS_Store**  
  System file created by macOS. It is not used in the project and can be safely ignored.

## Getting Started

To run or modify any of the chatbot scripts:
1. Ensure you have Python installed along with required dependencies.
2. For Cohere API usage, include your API key and other credentials where needed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Cohere API (for `Cohere.py` and `Cohere.ipynb`)
- Additional dependencies listed in individual scripts.

## Notes

This repository serves as a testing ground for various chatbot models and embedding techniques. Files may represent different iterations or experimental approaches.
