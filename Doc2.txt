1. ForMussolini,whywasFascismsuperiortoliberalismandsocialism?
In this text, Benito Mussolini argues that Fascism is superior to liberalism and socialism for multiple reasons. Firstly, Fascism sees war as a necessary and transformative force that can enhance human energy and nobility, while liberalism and socialism prioritize peaceful resolutions and reject war as a means to achieve objectives. Mussolini argues that the rejection of pacifism is a core tenet of Fascism, which suggests that ideologies that advocate for peaceful solutions and diplomacy are inadequate in the face of the realities of life. Secondly, Fascism opposes internationalistic systems that emphasize international cooperation, which could include liberal and socialist ideas. By rejecting these systems, Fascism prioritizes the interest and identity of the nation-state over international collaboration. Finally, the text mentions that Mussolini rejected socialism as he did not see it as a suitable ideology for the kind of struggle and sacrifice that he believed were necessary for the development and ennoblement of society. Fascism's disdain for socialism stems from its rejection of collective ownership and control of the means of production, as well as its opposition to socialist ideas of class equality.
Mussolini’s Fascism promotes a posiQve philosophy of life, wherein individuals are expected to accept and love life as a duty on criQques of exisQng societal structures without necessarily emphasizing a posiQve philosophy of individual duty and responsibility. Fascism, with its moRo “Me ne frego” (it doesn’t maRer”), implies a rejecQon of liberal and socialist ideals, emphasizing individualism and a disregard for external concerns1. As menQoned earlier, Mussolini posits that Fascism represents a new and superior way of life for Italy. Fascism explicitly denies the principles of Marxist Socialism. Mussolini challenges the feasibility of majority rule and rejects the idea of levelling individuals through mechanisms like universal suffrage, asserQng the superiority of a system that doesn’t adhere to these socialist tenants.
According to him, the twenQeth century should not be dominated by liberalism, socialism, or democracy but rather by ‘the Right and Fascism’ indicaQng a belief in the inherent superiority of Fascist ideology. The state, as the keystone of fascist doctrine, is considered superior to liberal and socialist concepts. Mussolini places the state as an ‘ethical’ enQty, emphasizing its consciousness and will, suggesQng that the state is Fascism is a superior and more meaningful organizaQon than liberal or socialist alternaQves. Fascism’s concepQon of the state as a spiritual and moral fact reinforces its

superiority over liberalism and socialism. The state is not just a poliQcal or economic enQty but a superior moral force, according to Mussolini’s ideology. Therefore, a fascist state is considered to be a strong expression of power and governance. Also, the tendency for a naQon to build an empire is a sign of vitality and strength. As naQons that expand and express themselves on a larger scale are considered alive and vibrant. Whereas, the naQons that remain isolated or passive are seen as declining. Mussolini suggests that every era has its dominant ideology, and for the present age, he asserts fascism is the most relevant and fi^ng doctrine.
In essence, Mussolini believed that Fascism was superior to liberalism and socialism, due to its emphasis on war, rejection of pacifism, opposition to internationalism and socialism, and promotion of a particular philosophy of life that emphasized duty and ascent. He believed that these aspects made Fascism better suited to meet the challenges and realities of human existence and development when compared to liberal and socialist ideologies.
2. For Mussolini, how important was the state?
In Mussolini's view of Fascism, the most crucial aspect is how he sees the state—the very core of its existence, its duties, and what it aims to achieve. According to Fascism, the state is considered the most important, making groups and individuals less significant in comparison. Even though individuals and groups have their own rights within the state, the overall well-being of the whole community takes precedence, leading to collaboration for future goals. The document emphasizes that the state, according to Fascism, has its own consciousness and a unique will, making it an 'ethical' State.
Unlike a narrow perspective of the state merely ensuring personal safety or overseeing imperial peace, Mussolini sees the Fascist state as having a broader role. It acts as both an internal and external protector, revealing a shared mission to its people and guiding them through different social levels. From the basic existence of a tribe to the highest level of human expression—the empire—the state is a rising force. Instead of suppressing the voice of the common person, the Fascist state amplifies it, directing collective efforts toward a shared mission. It maintains a delicate balance between overarching state objectives and individual rights, curbing excesses while safeguarding essential freedoms.
Mussolini underscores that, for him, the Fascist state symbolizes a determination for power and governance. More than just a territorial, military, or mercantile entity, the ideal of Fascism extends into the spiritual and moral realms. The inclination toward empire, representing the expression of nations, is, in the Fascist ideology, seen as a sign of vitality. On the contrary, choosing to stay within one's confines is seen as a sign of decline. Those who rise or experience resurgence are considered imperialist, embodying the vigor and dynamism of a people on the rise. Conversely, those who stagnate are considered renunciatory, resigning themselves to a fate of decline.
According to Mussolini, Fascism is uniquely suited to reflect the hopes and prevailing feelings of a population. Using the Italian people as an example, who have endured centuries of neglect and oppression by foreign powers, Mussolini sees Fascism as a

doctrine aligned with the revival of a nation. Importantly, Mussolini doesn't idealize the idea of an empire; instead, he acknowledges the inherent difficulties it brings. Building empires requires discipline, coordinated efforts, unwavering commitment, and a willingness to make sacrifices. In the pursuit of an empire, the Fascist state becomes a proving ground where the resilience and fortitude of a nation are tested and refined. This underscores the vital role that Mussolini attributes to the state, viewing it as the driving force behind the rejuvenation and strength of the nation.
In conclusion, Mussolini's ideological framework emphasizes the centrality of the state in Fascist doctrine, portraying it as an ethical entity that guides the collective consciousness. Fascism, for Mussolini, transcends mere political or economic dimensions; it embodies a holistic ideal that encompasses spiritual, moral, and imperialistic facets. The movement's appeal lies in its ability to resonate with the aspirations of a resurging people, such as the Italians, emerging from historical trials. Yet, Mussolini acknowledges the rigors of empire- building, requiring a harmonious blend of discipline, coordination, duty, and sacrifice. As Mussolini asserts, if every age has its own doctrine, then, for his era, Fascism stands as the prevailing and pertinent ideology.
